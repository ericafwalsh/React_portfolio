                                        my projects.

                                        and joined a fast moving eCommerce startup, which was quickly acquired by one of

                                        There, as a buyer, I had a front-row seat to the competitive retail tech
                                        industry, which sparked
                                        my desire to become a web developer.

                                        critically and approach complex problems
                                        from a variety of angles, while keeping the customer top of mind.
